    """
    Transforms and joins game events with campaign data to produce aggregated insights.

    Steps:
    - Removes invalid/null records from both datasets
    - Aggregates total playtime and revenue per user from game events
    - Left-joins campaign clicks with game activity using 'user_id'
    - Fills in missing values for users with no activity

    Parameters:
        game_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing raw game event data
        campaign_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing campaign click data

    Returns:
